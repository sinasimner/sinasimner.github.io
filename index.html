        <div class="subheading mb-5">Neuroscience Major at the University of California, RiversideðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I, Sina Simner, am currently a neuroscience major at the University of California, Riverside. I aspire to achieve many great things with a degree in neuroscience and intend to go on to medical school in order to become a neurologist. I hope that in the future, I will succeed in medical school and will spend the rest of my life dedicating my time and knowledge to helping those who truly need it.
<br><br>

        I completed school and received my diploma at Woodbridge High School, in Irvine California. During my time in high school, I worked at the local Chick-fil-a, which is unrelated to my goals as a neuroscience major, but helped me learn many valuable lessons and skills that I can carry with me into the next chapter of my life. I learned how to interact with new people, which was sometimes difficult, but I was fortunate enough to have a great team of people supporting me. I made many long-lasting friendships with those I worked with and working in such a hectic environment as a fast-food restaurant helped us form stronger bonds with each other. Overall I believe that from my two years working at Chick-fil-a, I gained valuable teamwork skills, as well as skills in socialization.
<br><br>

        During my time in high school, I also worked as a volunteer at the Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Riverside. My time there was not long, but working at the medical center gave me work experience that I wouldnâ€™t be able to find anywhere else. Being close to the nurses and doctors, watching the way they worked and the way the hospital operated, made me certain that I wanted to enter into medicine. During my time volunteering at the medical center, I spent a lot of time in the maternal ward, meaning I was allowed to interact with the new mothers and take care of some of their needs. This also allowed me to shadow doctors and nurses as they interacted with the new mothers, which helped me understand how to deal with patients in the proper fashion. In addition to this, I am currently in the midst of acquiring my emergency medical technician (EMT) certification, so I can get back into the medical world. I believe that working as a first responder will help me gain working experience and skills that all people need if they wish to work in a hospital some day. As an EMT, I will need to learn to act under pressure and will gain the hands-on experience that I was not exposed to as a volunteer.
